## 🔭 Research Interests

### Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background (SGWB)
   - Searching for a SGWB using current generation detectors
   - Removing the gravitational-wave foreground generated by compact binary coalescenses (CBC) with next generation (XG) detectors.
   - Modeling the statistic properties (e.g. mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis,...) of a CBC foreground *Please check our upcoming work!!!*

### Hierarchical Bayesian Inference
   - Jointly modeling the CBC foreground and a SGWB with a cosmological origin
   - Test general relativity (GR)
   - Using SGWB to infer more physical parameters. E.g. other polarizations in non-GR theories, Hubble constant etc

### Machine Learning & Simulation-Based Inference (SBI)
   - Using a likelihood-free method to infer physical parameters

## 🤫 More About Myself
I was born in 1998 on a small island in Zhoushan, Zhejiang <span class="chinese-name">(浙江舟山)</span>, China. Around the age of 11, I became obsessed with a biweekly magazine called *The Journal of UFO Research* <span class="chinese-name">(《飞碟探索》)</span>. I was fascinated by all the stories about UFOs, aliens, and the possibility of highly intelligent life on distant extroplantes. That early curiosity made *(astro)physics* my favorite subject starting in middel school.

After taking the National College Entrance Examniation <span class="chinese-name">(高考)</span> in 2017, I was addimitted to Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), where I spent 4 unforgettable years. In my second year, I joined Prof. Gong's research group to get a taste of research. The group's main focus was on *pulsars*, which, to be honest, wasn't a topic I found particularly exciting. (*You might be wondering why I chose to join a group working on something I wasn't that into--well, that's a long story, and maybe I'll tell you if we ever meet in person.*) 

One day during a one-on-one meeting, my advisor casually suggested that I look into gravitational waves and cold atom interferometers. That was the first time I encountered gravitational waves—and I was instantly hooked. At the end of my third year, we were required to do a research internship. While most of my classmates stayed on campus to work with local faculty, I reached out to Prof. Han at the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory and spent two months there working on the Effective-One-Body formalism.

After that internship, I began my senior thesis project, which focused on the SGWB generated by bubble collisions during first-order phase transitions. That work eventually became my first published paper.

In 2021, I started my PhD journey at the University of Minnesota under the supervision of Prof. Mandic. I’ll let you know how that story goes once I graduate…
